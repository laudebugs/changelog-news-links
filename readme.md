# Changelog News Links
This feed sources news articles posted on [changelog.com](changelog.com)'s news feed.

## Why
In my quest to find some of the best blog posts to read, Changelog provides far superior, non-clickbaity blog posts and articles that are quite insightful. Collecting these links would be a source of gold for anyone seeking to read through, or build some sort of app that would email me articles to peruse through since most of these articles are timeless.

## Caveats
- Changelog also posts their podcast links on the news feed, so the links contains links to the Changelog shows - which are awesome (Go listen pronto if you haven't), but these links are not web articles
- Some of these links are broken, i.e., they aren't working anymore


## TODO
- [X] Filter out `changelog.com` and `github.com` links. The former contains links to other posts as well as podcast episodes while the later contains links to github repositories (mostly)
- [ ] Check if all the links are working (not broken or moved), add a `status` property or sth
